## Ideas for what we might want to add for the ACCESS training day

I'm not going to prescribe a format for this document; if anyone else wants it to be formatted nicely they can go for it. I just can't be bothered.
The aim here is to put down a whole bunch of ideas that we can then sort through and build on my COSIMA training for the ACCESS NRI workshop. 
I'd really appreciate external input at this point so that we don't end up with a training that's just the things that have bothered me in the past.

* Examples are pretty much all COSIMA, I'd like to include a combination of CMIP datasets, intake stuff, open_mfdataset,
* In a perfect universe we'd find a way to have people bring their own data too? Are they likely to have datasets? 
I'm guessing if they've got some previous experience then they've got data that they're analysing suboptimally, so then it'd be good to have a 
chance to try fix that. Also, having examples applicable to one-self is always good. Failing that, I can ask around for some datasets that are ATMO/OCEAN/CM/LAND/ML.
* I'm wondering if we want to use everyone in the room as a parallel computer? I can't tell if this is a terrible idea or a brilliant idea, to start with a list of numbers we need
  to sum and distribute them as single numbers or as bigger piles. Maybe it works in small groups of 3-4?
* I think we want everyone to have 4 hours of 7 cores - enough to see that parallelisation is important, but few enought that you actually want to be smart about it
* I'm not sure how much more useful content is worth adding to the slides, so maybe we slow down a little bit along the way with everyone going through my notebooks not just me, 
and then we make the end freeform "try fix this code" or "try and improve your own code" depending on your propensity.
* xr.apply_ufunc needs to be more broadly updated, which means I need to learn how to use it better :)
* Try put Charles' cell magic to check for storage in there



## Additional examples of broken code
* Fishing out bottom age with a full 4D mask or a 2D index changes behaviour a lot


## Please put some more stuff in here! I'll go through the week of the 18th August and turn this brainstorm into an actual plan
